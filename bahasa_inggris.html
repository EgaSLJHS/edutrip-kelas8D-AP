        <h2>Malioboro: The Street Full of Culture</h2>
        <p>Malioboro Street is one of Yogyakarta’s most famous streets, with as many stores as your heart desires. I was privileged to visit that street with my friends during my trip to Yogyakarta. The streets hum with the sounds of people, accompanied by a beautiful vintage look, and lanterns lighting up the streets with a warm glow during the night. The air was filled with the smell of sizzling skewers all mixed in with the sounds of vendors offering their products. It was there that I realized that, Malioboro Street is filled with tons of unique culture-filled stores that serve as places to eat or spend your money away.
        </p>
        <h2>The Culture-Filled Stores of Malioboro</h2>
        <p>In Malioboro Street, you get to encounter plenty of vendors ready for their eye-catching collection. There were waves of stores selling pieces of clothing from one of the millions of cultures Indonesia has. And they were sold for a steal! Beautiful and mesmerizing clothes were being sold for the low. After that, some stores sold a wide arsenal of eccentric toys and souvenirs with a vintage yet brand-new look to them. There were also restaurants or vendors on the side of the street selling mouth-watering Indonesian food or from other cultures. But always be aware of the scammers waiting for you at every moment.
        </p>
        <h2>Plaza Malioboro, Malioboro’s Magnificent Monument</h2>
        <p>While exploring every nook & cranny Malioboro Street had to offer, I decided to visit the magnificent Plaza Malioboro. The mall stood out as a modern contrast to the vintage streets, with its clear glass windows, bright lights, and popular brands. When I first entered I was happily greeted with some Japanese culture in the form of “Ramen Ya!”. When I saw the menu, my mouth began to drool at the amount of delicious types of ramen they had. Of course, me and my friends decided to fill our stomachs up there. The ramen served was delicious, with a light yet flavor-intense broth and rubbery yet soft noodles. After being filled up with exquisite food, me and my friends decided to explore the stores. They had fashion stores, arcades, and even an Indonesia National Team store. But I ended up buying myself Pokémon cards.
        </p>
        <h2>The Wild Army of Delicious Food!        </h2>
        <p>Other than an endless variety of things to buy, Malioboro Street also has a mind-blowing variety of food to offer. From Indonesian food to food from foreign countries to fast food, Malioboro has it all. The street also had tasty little snacks like refreshing ice cream, fluffy and sweet cotton candy, and Yogyakarta’s signature food bakpia. But if you feel like filling yourself up, the street sells many delicious main courses like the popular Gudeg from Yogyakarta!
        <p>In conclusion, Malioboro Street is filled with tons of unique culture-filled stores that serve as places to eat or spend your money away. If you’re looking to spend your money away on unique items and delicious food, then get yourself a ticket to Malioboro Street. At any store you visit, you’re bound to find something unique and interesting. From sunrise stalls to midnight bites, Malioboro Street isn’t just a destination, it’s an experience that stays with you.
